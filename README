Zadify

Capstone Project for Zach Durtschi

The project plan is included in the repository. The final product will be a gamification Android application.

This project is written in Visual C#. It also uses Mono for Android. Unit Testing will be added soon, since the original framework is incompatible with Mono for Android. Logging is done through Android's own logging system. Commits are made with Github for Windows.
