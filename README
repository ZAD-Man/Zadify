Zadify

Capstone Project for Zach Durtschi

The project plan is included in the repository. The final product will be a gamification Android application.

This project is written in Visual C#. It also uses Mono for Android. Unit Testing and Logging will be added soon, since the original frameworks are incompatible with Mono for Android. Commits are made with Github for Windows.
