Validate goal info
Show a list of goals
Web Services
-Read more about different services, choose one
-Write something that just gets text and displays it, then one that sends text, gets it back altered, and displays it.
-Determine the nature of the database needed.
-Make a simple, 2 column database table; add something and pull something out of it in code.
-Expand that: User table, connected to self w/ "is friends with" relationship; Competition table, two foreign keys to indicate competitors;News table, just user ID and snippets of text about activity (be sure to make a setting for opting in to/out of sharing).
Custom Goals: Should be very similar to predefined, just have to figure out form/storage that will still work in the Goal list.
